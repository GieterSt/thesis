## 📊 Research Methodology

### Evaluation Framework
- **Scenarios:** 72 real-world greenhouse LED scheduling optimization tasks
- **Timeframe:** January 2024 - April 2025
- **Evaluation Criteria:** 
  - API Success Rate (reliability)
  - Optimization Accuracy (performance vs. ground truth)
  - Overall Score (API Success × Optimization Accuracy)

### Ground Truth Comparison
Models are evaluated against optimal cost-efficient LED schedules with:
- **PPFD Allocation Accuracy:** Mean Absolute Error (MAE) calculation

- **Perfect Match Rate:** Exact optimization achievements

## 🎯 Production Deployment Recommendations

### Tier 1: Production Ready
**Claude Opus 4**
- ✅ 100% API reliability
- ⚠️ Limited optimization accuracy requires further investigation
- ✅ Consistent performance across scenarios

### Tier 2: Research Viable (Limited Production Use)
**OpenAI O1**
- ⚠️ 60% API reliability issues
- ⚠️ Limited optimization accuracy
- ⚠️ Expensive for production scale

### Tier 3: Development/Testing Only
- **Claude 3.7 Sonnet:** Requires analysis to determine performance characteristics
- **Llama 3.3 70B:** Reliable but limited optimization capabilities
- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview:** Requires analysis to determine performance characteristics
- **DeepSeek R1 Distill Qwen 7B:** Requires analysis to determine performance characteristics

## 📋 Key Lessons Learned

### 1. API Reliability vs Model Capability
API success rates don't always correlate with optimization performance, highlighting the need for comprehensive evaluation metrics.

### 2. Production Deployment Complexity
Real-world AI deployment requires:
- ✅ **Advanced reasoning capabilities** (AI model quality)
- ✅ **Engineering robustness** (response handling, error recovery)
- ✅ **Operational reliability** (consistent performance)
- ✅ **Cost effectiveness** (sustainable economics)

### 3. Research vs. Production Gap
Models that perform well in research settings may fail in production without proper engineering support. The gap between laboratory performance and real-world deployment is often bridged by engineering excellence, not just model sophistication.
