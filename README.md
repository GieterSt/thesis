## Research Insights

### Thesis Support: "When Small Isn't Enough"

This research provides strong empirical evidence that complex optimization tasks require large-scale models:

1. **Clear Performance Thresholds**: Below certain scales, models fail completely at structured optimization
2. **Scale-Performance Correlation**: Larger models demonstrate superior optimization capabilities
3. **Task Complexity Matters**: Multi-objective scheduling requires sophisticated reasoning capabilities
4. **Practical Deployment**: Production systems need both scale and architectural reliability

### Key Conclusions

- **Complex optimization tasks** have minimum scale requirements for basic functionality
- **Large-scale models** (100B+ parameters) achieve production-ready performance
- **Architectural design** impacts reliability as much as raw parameter count
- **Cost justification** exists for premium models in critical optimization applications
