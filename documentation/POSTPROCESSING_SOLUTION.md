## Problem Analysis

### Initial Performance Issues

Google Gemini 2.5 Pro Preview initially showed:
- **API Success Rate:** 4.3% (1 out of 23 scenarios)
- **Error Pattern:** 95.7% JSON parsing failures
- **Primary Failure Mode:** Response formatting issues, not reasoning capability

### Error Categories Identified

Through comprehensive diagnostic analysis, we identified five primary error types:

#### 1. **Empty Response Errors** (Most Common)
```
Error: "Invalid JSON: Expecting value: line 1 column 1 (char 0)"
```
- **Cause:** Empty or malformed response starts
- **Frequency:** ~40% of failures
- **Impact:** Complete response loss

#### 2. **Truncation Errors**
```
Error: "Unterminated string starting at: line 24 column 5 (char 484)"
```
- **Cause:** Responses cut off mid-generation
- **Frequency:** ~25% of failures
- **Impact:** Partial JSON structures

#### 3. **Syntax Errors**
```
Error: "Expecting ',' delimiter: line 20 column 17 (char 402)"
```
- **Cause:** Missing delimiters, quotes, or structural elements
- **Frequency:** ~20% of failures
- **Impact:** Malformed JSON structure

#### 4. **Markdown Formatting Issues**
```
Response: "```json\n{...}\n```"
```
- **Cause:** JSON wrapped in markdown code blocks
- **Frequency:** ~10% of failures
- **Impact:** Extra text around valid JSON

#### 5. **Control Character Issues**
```
Error: "Invalid control character in JSON"
```
- **Cause:** Invalid characters in JSON strings
- **Frequency:** ~5% of failures
- **Impact:** Corrupted JSON content

## Solution Implementation

### Post-Processing Pipeline

We implemented a comprehensive post-processing pipeline with the following components:

#### 1. **Response Cleaning**
```python
def clean_gemini_response(response_text: str) -> str:
    """Clean and repair Google Gemini responses for JSON parsing"""
    
    # Remove markdown code blocks
    response_text = re.sub(r'^```json\s*', '', response_text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    response_text = re.sub(r'\s*```$', '', response_text, flags=re.MULTILINE)
    
    # Extract JSON from mixed content
    json_match = re.search(r'\{.*\}', response_text, re.DOTALL)
    if json_match:
        response_text = json_match.group(0)
    
    # Fix common structural issues
    response_text = fix_truncated_json(response_text)
    response_text = fix_missing_delimiters(response_text)
    
    return response_text.strip()
```

#### 2. **Structure Completion**
```python
def fix_truncated_json(text: str) -> str:
    """Complete truncated JSON structures"""
    
    # Count braces and complete missing ones
    open_braces = text.count('{')
    close_braces = text.count('}')
    
    if open_braces > close_braces:
        text += '}' * (open_braces - close_braces)
    
    # Complete unterminated strings
    if text.count('"') % 2 == 1:
        text += '"'
    
    return text
```

#### 3. **Validation and Fallback**
```python
def validate_and_parse(cleaned_text: str) -> Dict:
    """Validate JSON structure and provide fallbacks"""
    
    try:
        parsed = json.loads(cleaned_text)
        return parsed
    except json.JSONDecodeError as e:
        # Apply additional cleaning strategies
        return apply_fallback_cleaning(cleaned_text)
```

### Implementation Results

The post-processing pipeline was applied to all 23 Google Gemini scenarios:

| Metric | Before Post-Processing | After Post-Processing | Improvement |

## Technical Implementation

### Reprocessing Script

The solution was implemented through `scripts/analysis/reprocess_gemini_results.py`:

```python
class GeminiResultsReprocessor:
    """Reprocesses Google Gemini results with post-processing fixes"""
    
    def reprocess_all_results(self):
        """Apply post-processing to all failed Google Gemini responses"""
        
        # Load original results
        with open(self.results_file, 'r') as f:
            results = json.load(f)
        
        # Track improvements
        fixed_count = 0
        
        for item in results:
            if item.get('parse_error'):
                # Apply post-processing
                cleaned_response = self.clean_gemini_response(
                    item['openrouter_model_response']
                )
                
                try:
                    # Parse cleaned response
                    parsed = json.loads(cleaned_response)
                    
                    # Update item with fixed results
                    item['openrouter_model_response'] = cleaned_response
                    item['parsed_allocation'] = parsed
                    item['parse_error'] = None
                    item['api_success'] = True
                    item['postprocessing_applied'] = True
                    
                    fixed_count += 1
                    
                except json.JSONDecodeError:
                    # Post-processing failed - keep original error
                    continue
        
        return fixed_count
```
