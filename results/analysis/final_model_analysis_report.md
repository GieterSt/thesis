- **Google Gemini:** Perfect reliability after post-processing fixes
- **OpenAI O1:** Moderate reliability (60%) despite advanced reasoning
- **Meta Llama:** Excellent reliability (100%) with budget-friendly pricing

#### 3. **Performance vs. Reliability Trade-offs**
- Advanced reasoning models (O1, Gemini) initially suffered from reliability issues
- Post-processing techniques can bridge this gap
- Production deployment requires both capability AND reliability

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment
1. **Primary Choice:** Claude Opus 4 - Excellent balance of performance and reliability
2. **Cost-Effective Alternative:** Llama 3.3 70B - Good performance at lower cost
