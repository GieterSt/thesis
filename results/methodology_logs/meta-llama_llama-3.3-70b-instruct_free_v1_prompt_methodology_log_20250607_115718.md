# Analysis Methodology Report

**Model:** meta-llama_llama-3.3-70b-instruct_free_v1_prompt
**Analysis Date:** 20250607_115718

## Step-by-Step Analysis Process

### Step 1: API Success Rate Measurement
**Objective:** Assess the model's ability to respond to optimization requests
**Method:** Count non-null responses from 72 API calls
**Result:** 54 successful calls = 75.0% success rate
**Interpretation:** This measures basic task capability - can the model handle LED optimization requests?

### Step 2: JSON Parsing Capability
**Objective:** Evaluate structured output generation for automated systems
**Method:** Parse each response for valid JSON format with required allocation fields
**Result:** 54 valid JSON responses = 75.0% success rate
**Interpretation:** Critical for automated LED control systems requiring structured data

### Step 3: Ground Truth Comparison
**Objective:** Compare model allocations against optimal greedy algorithm solutions
**Method:** For each test case, compare hourly PPFD allocations with mathematically optimal solution
**Ground Truth Source:** Greedy algorithm generating optimal LED schedules
**Metrics Calculated:**
- Exact 24-hour matches: 0/54 (0.0%)
- Mean hourly accuracy: 54.0%
- Mean absolute error: 109.59 PPFD per hour
- Daily total error: 674.25 PPFD
**Interpretation:** Higher percentages indicate better optimization quality

### Step 4: Performance Statistical Analysis
**Response Time Analysis:**
- Average response time: 4.55 seconds
- Total processing time: 245.7 seconds
**Cost Category:** PAID model
**Thesis Quality Score:** EXCELLENT
